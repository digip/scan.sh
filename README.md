scan.sh - an ASUS RT-AC66U Port Scanner shell script by DigiP

This is a clunky, and slow port scanner that uses a built in utility to the ASUS RT-AC66U router. It may also be available
on other ASUS home routers. I was able to use this to scan both my internal lan as well as domains on the web.

Basics of the script are commented for where you can make changes for the port ranges. This will be very slow and take a while to check all ports, but only returns the ones it sees as open.

This will also do an arp at the end to see connected devices it has found on the same subnet(s).
